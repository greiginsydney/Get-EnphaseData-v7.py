# Get-EnphaseData-v7.py
A custom sensor for PRTG that queries your on-site Enphase solar controller, the Envoy. (v7 version)

This version is specific to v7 firmware, with its requirement for an authorisation token from Enphase.

If you're still on v5, you'll want [this script](https://github.com/greiginsydney/Get-EnphaseData.py) instead.

See [greiginsydney.com/get-enphasedata-v7-py](https://greiginsydney.com/get-enphasedata-v7-py) for the story...

Problems with the script? Please open a new Issue on the tab above.
